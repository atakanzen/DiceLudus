# DiceLudus 
A  simple JavaScript game I created for practice purposes.
<h2>Rules</h2>
<ul>
<li>Set a winning score</li>
<li>Roll the dices every round to add scores to your current round score.</li>
  <li>If one of the dices is <b>"1"</b>, current <b>round score</b> will reset and the game turn will pass on to the next player.</li>
  <li>If you roll <b>"double six"</b> twice in a row, your <b>general score</b> will reset and the game turn will pass on to the next player.</li>
<li>Press "<b>Hold</b>" button to add your current score to your <b>general score.</b></li>
</ul>
<h3>You can start a <b>new game</b> by pressing the "New Game" button.</h3>
<h2>Enjoy!</h2>
