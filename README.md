# RoseBeefGame
A  simple JavaScript game I created for practice purposes.
<h2>Rules</h2>
<ul>
<li>Roll the dice every round to add scores to your current round score.</li>
<li>If the dice is "1", current round score will reset and the game turn will pass on to the next player.</li>
<li>Press "<b>Hold</b>" button to add your current score to your <b>general score.</b></li>
<li>Whoever gets "<b>100</b>" scores wins!</li>
</ul>
<h3>You can start a <b>new game</b> by pressing the "New Game" button.</h3>
<h2>Enjoy!</h2>
